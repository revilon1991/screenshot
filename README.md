# Screenshot

### Introduction

Take a screenshot and store that at the remote server.

This application has a wire between GoLang and Objective-C languages.
It needs for to read OSX system events and capture screenshots.

Now it's developing. So you can't use it fully, but you can already see captured screenshots in your terminal after run.

Soon I'll finish that, and you'll be able to download stable release.

### Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/revilon1991/screenshot.git
cd screenshot
make
```
_It's expected that [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) was installed in your operating system._

### Usage
```shell
./screenshot
```
You can look for your terminal.

It'll show your screenshot path and create date every time when you do screenshot.
